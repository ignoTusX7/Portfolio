      <p className="text-lg mt-2 text-justify font-mono">
        I&apos;m Moksh, a dedicated BCA student with a fervent interest in web
        development and artificial intelligence. My journey into the tech world
        started with a curiosity for its boundless possibilities. Proficient in
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web frameworks, I specialize in
        crafting responsive and captivating web applications.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mt-2 text-justify font-mono">
        Beyond coding, I strongly believe in giving back to the tech community.
        I actively contribute to open-source projects on GitHub, where I engage
        with fellow developers and strive to make technology more inclusive.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mt-2 text-justify font-mono">
        Outside of tech, I indulge in exploring the fusion of technology and
        creativity, diving into books, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee. I&apos;m
        enthusiastic about new opportunities and collaborations, so don&apos;t
        hesitate to connect if you share my passions!
